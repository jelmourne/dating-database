## Matchable database

**Description**
The **matchable** database is designed for a mobile dating application where users can signup and find local singles to match with. Matches can then message each other to schedule meetups or just talk over text. Additionally, users can reserve places to events such as parties, movies, or picnics that are scheduled in the area for many users to attend and discover others outside of the application.

**Expected data**
Users will be able to sign up with their email, phone, and a password, once signed up they have a choice to create a profile for other users to find or do it another time. Once a profile has been created users can swipe/like other profiles within the same location and that match their preferences. Once a user has swiped/liked a profile the users profile will appear in the matches table along with a foreign key to the profile the user has liked and a boolean if they liked them back. As well, users reserve a spot to attend many unique events in their area where they can find other users, these events can host many users.
